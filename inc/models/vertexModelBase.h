//!A class that can calculate many geometric and topological features common to vertex models
/*!
This class captures many energy-functional-independent features common to 2D vertex models of cells.
It can compute geometric features of cells, such as their area and perimeter; it knows that in vertex
models the degrees of freedom are the vertices (for returning the right vector of forces, moving
d.o.f. around, etc.); and it is where a geometric form of cell division is implemented.

Vertex models have to maintain the topology of the cell network by hand, so child classes need to
implement not only an energy functional (and corresponding force law), but also rules for topological
transitions. This base class will implement a very simple T1 transition scheme
Only T1 transitions are currently implemented, and they occur whenever two vertices come closer
than a set threshold distance. All vertices are three-valent.
